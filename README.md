piano-madness
=============

Code, notes and general foolishness related to the mechanical piano project.

Begun at the BuildSomething hackathon on 10-AUG-2013 at Foulab, the project
involves connecting a leap motion to drive a mechanical player piano via a
servo and a stepper, which in turn controls a keyboard via midi.

Project was begun because we didn't really have a plan, but the player piano
looked cool.
